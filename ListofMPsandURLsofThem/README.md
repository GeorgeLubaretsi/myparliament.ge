Create a list of MPnames based on parliament.ge website,
create for each MP a number of urls,
       to his homepage at parliament, to all his asset declarations, to wikipedia, twitter, linkedin and facebook
and turn it into  insert statements into the table representative_url 

 only georgian version, because with Englsih version name matching (eg with Asset Declartion)  is too buggy.
