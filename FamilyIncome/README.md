Code to create the family income of a person given his Asset Declaration.

The code generates an XML file based on all Asset DEclarations.
From these a HTML, CSV and SQL imprt statements view is generated.

In the present version of FamilyIncome.xquery a filter is set to only run it on members of Parliament. 

The script takes very long to run.

Hard paths to Asset dEclaration data and to XML utilities need to be reset.
